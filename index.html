        JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.

        JavaScript is a single-threaded language which means it executes one task at a time.
        It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
        The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript that‚Äôs why it is called dynamically typed.
        Key Features of JavaScript
Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript runs on the user‚Äôs browser, so has a faster response time without needing to communicate with the server.
Versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex server-side applications.
Event-Driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, keystrokes) in real-time.
Asynchronous: JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface.
Rich Ecosystem: There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which make development faster and more efficient.
